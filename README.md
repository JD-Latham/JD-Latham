### 📸 More About Me

Beyond the code editor, I have two main passions:

1.  **Photography:** I enjoy capturing the world through a lens, which helps me see composition, light, and design in new ways—skills that translate directly into game art and level design.
2.  **Video Games:** I play a wide variety of titles, constantly analyzing their mechanics, engagement loops, and narrative structures to inform my own development work.
